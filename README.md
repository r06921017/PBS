# Greedy PBS
A suboptimal solver for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)

Priority-Based Search (PBS) is an efficient suboptimal algorithm for solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF).
More details can be found in our paper at AAAI 2019 [1]. 
(This implementation is not the original code for producing the results in the paper.)

The implementation provides a SIPP option that uses SIPPS [2] (instead of state-time A*) 
on the low level of PBS to plan paths for agents.

On top of that, we propose Greedy PBS (GPBS) with other improved techniques that aims to minimize the number of collisions during the search. We also implement four enhancements to speed up the search: Partial Expansion (PE), Target Reasoning (TR), Induced Constraints (IC), and Soft Restart (SR).

## Usage
The code requires the external library [boost](https://www.boost.org/).
If you are using Ubantu, you can install it simply by
```shell script
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
``` 
Another easy way of installing the boost library is to install anaconda/miniconda and then
```shell script
conda install -c anaconda libboost
```
which works for a variety of [systems](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/libboost)
(including linux, osx, and win).

If neither of the above method works, you can also follow the instructions
on the [boost](https://www.boost.org/) website and install it manually.


After you installed boost and downloaded the source code, go into the directory of the source code and compile it with CMake:
```shell script
mkdir build && ccd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
```

Then, you are able to run the code:
```
./pbs -m random-32-32-20.map -a random-32-32-20-random-1.scen -k 50 -t 60 --solver GPBS --tr true --ic true --rr true --rth 0 -o test.csv --outputPaths=paths.txt
```

- m: the map file from the MAPF benchmark
- a: the scenario file from the MAPF benchmark
- k: the number of agents
- t: the runtime limit
- solver: which solver to use (our GPBS already contains partial expansion)
- tr: whether to use target reasoning (only for GPBS, *default:True*)
- ic: whether to use induced constraint maximizations (only for GPBS, *default:True*)
- rr: whether to use soft restart (only for GPBS, *default:True*)
- rth: the number of backtracking we allow before restart (only valid if `rr` is set true, *default:True*)
- o: the output file that contains the search statistics
- outputPaths: the path to store the paths of the solution.

You can find more details and explanations for all parameters with:
```
./pbs --help
```

To test the code on more instances,
you can download the MAPF instances from the [MAPF benchmark](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html).
In particular, the format of the scen files is explained [here](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/formats.html).
For a given number of agents k, the first k rows of the scen file are used to generate the k pairs of start and target locations.
